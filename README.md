# Python_Flask_Projects
This is a repository of unique Flask projects that you can either use as ideas for your next Flask project or as a source to learn from. Each project contains the full source code and is listed in order of difficulty level. It starts with the easiest project, and with every new project, you will be building more challenging flask web applications. Have a peek and enjoy codding!


## 01_Guess_The_Number_game
This is the  starting project where we create a simple web app developed using Python's web framework, Flask. The user will play a guess the number game, where on the main page the user will be prompted with a question of selecting a number between 0 and 9 and a changing number animation.
The user is supposed to type the guessed number into the path. The web app will then tell us whether we chose the right number or if our guess was too low or high.

## 02_Name_Card_website
This is a web-based name card using one of the templates on HTML 5 Up (https://html5up.net/).
It is exactly like the old school paper name cards, just better.
It was developed using Python's web framework, Flask.

# 03_Blog_website
This is a blog website developed using Python's web framework, Flask.
The main page consists of a list of posts, with the option "Read", which will redirect the user into a detailed view of the given post.
The data for each post is stored using an API (https://www.npoint.io/), which converts our data into an easily accessible API endpoint. The blog website makes a request to this endpoint and retrieves a JSON data representation for each post, which is later rendered into HTML.
