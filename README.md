## Python_Flask_Projects
This is a repository of unique Flask projects that you can either use as ideas for your next Flask project or as a source to learn from. Each project contains the full source code and is listed in order of difficulty level. It starts with the easiest project, and with every new project, you will be building more challenging flask web applications. Have a peek and enjoy codding!


# 01_Guess_The_Number_game
This is the  starting project where we create a simple web app developed using Python's web framework, Flask. The user will play a guess the number game, where on the main page the user will be prompted with a question of selecting a number between 0 and 9 and a changing number animation.
The user is supposed to type the guessed number into the path. The web app will then tell us whether we chose the right number or if our guess was too low or high.
